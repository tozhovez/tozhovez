# How To Sort A Dictionary By Value in Python?

**Summary:** Use one of the following methods to sort a dictionary by value:

1. Using The **sorted\(dict1, key=dict1.get\)** Method.
2. Using **Dictionary Comprehension** And **Lambda** With **sorted\(\)** Method.
3. Using **OrderedDict** \(For Older Versions Of Python\).
4. Using **itemgetter\(\)** with **sorted\(\)** Method.
5. Using **Counter** subclass.

**Problem:** Given a [dictionary](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary/); how to sort it by values?

**Example:** The following example shows a dictionary by the name `rank` that stores the names of individuals as the keys while their corresponding ranks represent the values. We shall be using this example as a reference while discussing the solutions.

```text
rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

# Some Procedure to Sort the Dictionary by its Values
```

**Output:**

```text
{'Dwyane': 1, 'Bob': 2, 'John': 3, 'Alice': 4, 'Sharon': 5}
```

Before we dive into the solutions here are a few **Points To Remember** about dictionaries:

* From Python 3.7 onwards, Python dictionaries are ordered \(Insertion is also ordered\). This means the ordered in which the keys are inserted into dictionaries are preserved.
* In normal scenario sorting dictionaries, results in a sorted dictionary with respect to its keys.

To get a better insight into Python dictionaries, please follow our Blog Tutorial on dictionaries [**here**](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary/). However, the purpose of this article is purely to guide you through the numerous methods to sort a dictionary based on the values instead of the keys. So without further delay let us dive into the solutions.

‚û§ Here‚Äôs a quick overview of all the methods used in this article. Please follow the slide show give below:

## Method 1: Using The **sorted\(dict1, key=dict1.get\)** Method

The `sorted()` method is an in-built method in Python which is used to sort the elements of an iterable in a specific order \(**ascending** or **descending**\). After sorting the elements it returns the sorted sequence, in the form of a sorted list.

**Syntax:**

In order to sort the dictionary using the values, we can leverage the power of the `sorted()` function. To sort the dictionary based on the value, we can use the `get()` method and pass it to the `key` argument of the `sorted()` function.

Let us have a look at the following code to understand the usage of `sorted` function in order to solve our problem:

```text
rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

for w in sorted(rank, key=rank.get):
    print(w, rank[w])
```

**Output:**

```text
Dwyane 1
Bob 2
John 3
Alice 4
Sharon 5
```

In order to sort the dictionary using its values in reverse order, we need to specify the `reverse` argument as `true`, i.e.,

```text
rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

for w in sorted(rank, key=rank.get, reverse=True):
    print(w, rank[w])
```

**Output:**

```text
Sharon 5
Alice 4
John 3
Bob 2
Dwyane 1
```

## Method 2: Using **Dictionary Comprehension** And **Lambda** With **sorted\(\)** Method

If you are using [Python 3.6 and above](https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-check-your-python-version/) then our problem can be solved in a single line using a dictionary comprehension and a lambda function within the `sorted` method. This is an efficient and concise solution to sort dictionaries based on their values.

‚¶ø [**Dictionary Comprehension**](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary-comprehension/) is a concise and memory-efficient way to **create and initialize dictionaries** in one line of Python code. It consists of two parts: expression and context. The **expression** defines how to map keys to values. The **context** loops over an iterable using a single-line for loop and defines which \(key, value\) pairs to include in the new dictionary. To learn more about dictionary comprehensions in python have a look at our [blog tutorial here](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary-comprehension/).

Now, let us have a look at the following code given below that explains the usage of dictionary comprehensions to solve our problem in a single lie of code.

```text
rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

print({k: v for k, v in sorted(rank.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])})
```

**Output:**

```text
{'Dwyane': 1, 'Bob': 2, 'John': 3, 'Alice': 4, 'Sharon': 5}
```

## Method 3: Using **OrderedDict** \(For Older Versions Of Python\)

Dictionaries are generally unordered for versions prior to Python 3.7, so it is not possible to sort a dictionary directly. Therefore, to overcome this constraint we need to use the `OrderedDict` subclass.

‚¶ø An [**`OrderedDict`**](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary/#OrderedDict) is a dictionary subclass that preserves the order in which key-values are inserted in a dictionary. It is included in the `collections` module in Python.

Let us have a look at how we can use [**`OrderedDict`**](https://blog.finxter.com/python-dictionary/#OrderedDict) to order dictionaries in earlier versions of Python and sort them.

```text
from collections import OrderedDict
rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}
a = OrderedDict(sorted(rank.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))
for key,value in a.items():
  print(key, value)
```

**Output:**

```text
('Dwyane', 1)
('Bob', 2)
('John', 3)
('Alice', 4)
('Sharon', 5)
```

## Method 4: Using **itemgetter\(\)** With The **sorted\(\) Method**

‚¶ø `itemgetter()` is a built-in function of the `operator` module that constructs a callable that accepts an iterable like a list, tuple, set, etc as input and fetches the nth element out of it.

**Example:**

```text
from operator import itemgetter

rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

a = sorted(rank.items(), key=itemgetter(1))
print(dict(a))
```

**Output:**

```text
{'Dwyane': 1, 'Bob': 2, 'John': 3, 'Alice': 4, 'Sharon': 5}
```

In the above example `a` stores a list of tuples. Therefore we converted it to a `dictionary` explicitly, while printing.

## Method 5: Using **Counter**

[_**Counter**_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) is a dictionary subclass that is used for counting hashable objects. Since the values we are using are integers, we can use the `Counter` class to sort them. The `Counter` class has to be imported from the collections module.

**Disclaimer:** This is a work-around for the problem at hand and might not fit in every situation. Since, values of the dictionary in our case are integers, the **Counter** subclass fits as a solution to our problem. Consider it as a bonus trick!üòâ

```text
from collections import Counter

rank = {
  'Bob': 2,
  'Alice': 4,
  'Sharon': 5,
  'Dwyane': 1,
  'John': 3
}

count = dict(Counter(rank).most_common())
print(count)
```

**Output:**

```text
{'Dwyane': 1, 'Bob': 2, 'John': 3, 'Alice': 4, 'Sharon': 5}
```

‚¶ø In the above program the method `most_common()` has been used to return all elements in the Counter.
